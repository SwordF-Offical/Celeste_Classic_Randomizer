# Celeste_Classic_Randomizer_v1.0
A Pico-8 cart mod of Celeste Classic that randomizes the vanilla game with in-game settings.
This version uses a seed to generate this, and also has graphic options to select from.

This version will allow you to randomize the following:
  - Player's spawn position and allowing multiple clones on the same screen.
  - Generating tiles associated with berries. (i.e. fake wall, key, chest, fruit, and fly fruit)
  - Replacing the vanilla terrain by inserting their tiles into the tile pool.
  - Randomizing background tiles
